    "Preliminary discussion of the implementation of two STS-NIR devices to collect spectral data. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup detailed [here](https://github.com/calugo/AgroSightSPECY) was deployed to collect data and compute the reflectance index $R$. The system consists of two STS-NIR devices, a white reference and a cos-corrected filter respectively. Data for black current references was obtained by computing spectra by night with blocked fiber optics. The white references were collected by using a reflectant standard surface for the cos-corrected fiber and sunlight for the white reference filtered fiber. In both cases the measurements were obtained at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](picsrep/IMG3.jpg) F1. Setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a number of measurments the white surface standard was replaced by a green target. Three targets are reported here: venus flytrap, a single leaf plant and grass. while the white reference was kept recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](picsrep/IMN.png) F2. Targets for tests, left: Flytrap, right: Leaf. Grass was also used.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data acquistion process the temperature of the sensors was also tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temperature signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the temperature is not going to be mention any further in the results, we briefly present the sensor's temperature variation obtained while gatherig the data. This is just to show that the white and cos-corrected sensors are sensitive to the environment and the operation time so attention to this issue perhaps should be taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](temp.png) F3. Sensor temperatures during the data acquisition for the results discussed here. __Top:__ Temperature during the black reference collection, each point corresponds to a measurement, it should be noticed that the temperatures for this case were higher than for the white case as this data was collected after several hours of making other tests. This data was collected during the night and indoors to ensure maximum lack of light. __Bottom:__ Sensor temperatures during the day light data collection. this data was taken between 9:00 and 11:30 a.m. outdoors. \n",
    "On both cases the device with the with the white filter always gets warmer than the one with the cos-corrected one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn into the spectra collected. The first step is to choose a black reference signal and use it to substract the black-current noise level. I chose two early signals obtained (measure 3) by blocking the sensors, this is because those are the closest in temperature to the ones collected in daylight (__Is this adequate?__). The two references are shown below.\n",

    "### Blocked sensor reference signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](blackrefs.png) F4. Black References. The idea is to produce an extensive data base of black references to query and calibrate depending on the temperature. So far I have around a 1000 data sets. Another option is to compute this before every measurement run. __This is something you have to decide.__\n",
    "\n",
    "These two signals used are the ones employed to compute all the results presented below.\n",

    "### White references and Reflectance.\n",
    "\n",
    "(__This needs to be agreed by Adolfo__)\n",
    "A way of computing $R$ is somehow suggested [here](http://www.spectrecology.com/2015/08/two-channel-radiometry-for-reflectance-oceanview-schematic/), which is summarised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_{k}$, $k=1,2$ represent the raw spectra obtained with the STS-devices, 1 being the cosine-corrector fibre and 2 the white fiber and let $y_{k,b}$ represent the respective black references. Then, if we obtain a white reference $y_{k,w}$ for each device by means of a standard lambertian surface and __I supposse__ a maximum sunlight. Then $R$ can be computed as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{lcr}\n",
    "\\mbox{Substract black ref} & s_k=y_k-y_{k,b} & (1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{Divide by white ref} & s'_k=s_k/y_{k,w} & (2) \\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{Divide cos-corr by white signal} & R=s'_1/s'_2 & (3) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R=\\frac{y_{2,w}}{y_{1,w}} \\frac{y_1-y_{1,b}}{y_2 - y_{2,b}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where 1 and 2 refer to the cos-corrected and white filters respectively, the prefactor $$\\Gamma_{2,1}=\\frac{y_{2,w}}{y_{1,w}}$$ is then a quantity that as well as the black references requires to be precomputed. __However is it really neccessary?. Even more, is this the way you though to compute $R$?, actually is it also necessary to substract the black levels to the white references?__ In any case, below I show you some results obtained by following this method.\n",

    "#### Flytrap, Leaf, Grass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I show the results of carrying out several measurements using STS-NIRs for three different plants a Venus flytrap (F5), a leaf (F6) and grass (F7). These were measured over a period of a couple of hours with a varying degree of sunlight, due to change in the sun position and cloud variation. In every figure I show the raw data from each of the spectrometers with labels as described above. The second row in the figure contains a minor correction I used to avoid division by zero which is adding to the signal the minimum value of the array plus $\\delta=1e-6$, the third row  shows the ratios with and without prefactor $\\Gamma_{2,1} which according to the definion given above corresponds to  $R$ (Up to a constant factor). These spectra are yet to be rescaled in the x axis to indicate the wavelength, but are in the NIR range.\n",

    "### White vs White.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I am still not very certain about the scaling factor between white references, I did have a quick look to the difference between raw spectra from the white filter and a Lambert reference using the cos corrected. The relation is quite linear until the IR limit is reached, then it is quite strange..... but I suppose this is something that perhaps it is not relevant at the moment. The shape of this scaling pretty much indicates the scaling factor between the two STS devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spectra collected by the fiber with the white reference is more sensitive to changes in light conditions compared to the Lambert reflectance. I really do not know if this is relevant or not, but I would be happy to dig more into this, so the device and the scripts take everyhing into account.\n",
