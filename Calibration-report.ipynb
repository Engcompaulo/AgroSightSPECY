    "Preliminary discussion of the implementation of two STS-NIR devices to collect spectral data. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "The setup detailed [here](https://github.com/calugo/AgroSightSPECY) was deployed to collect data and compute the reflectance index $R$. The system consists of two STS-NIR devices, a white reference and a cos-corrected filter respectively. Data for black current references was obtained by computing 500 spectra by night and blocked fiber optics and then references using a reflectant standard surface (cosine filter) and sunlight (white reference). In both cases the measurements were obtained at the same time.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](picsrep/IMG3.jpg) F1. Setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a number of measurments the white surface standard was replaced by a target. Three targets are reported here: venus flytrap, a single leaf plant and grass. while the white reference was kept recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](picsrep/IMN.png) F2. Targets for tests, left: Flytrap, right: Leaf. Grass was also used.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the data acquistion process the temperature of the sensors was also tracked.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Temperature signatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the temperature is not going to be mention any further in the spectra discussion, we briefly present the temperature obtained while gatherig the data. This is just to show that the white and cos-corrected sensors are sensitive to the environment and the operation time thus attention to this issue should perhaps need to taken into account. \n",
    "\n",
    "![](temp.png) F3. Sensor temperatures during the data acquisition for the results discussed here. __Top:__ Temperature during the black reference collection, each point corresponds to a measurement, it should be noticed that the temperatures for this case were higher than for the white case as this data was collected after several hours of making other tests. This data was collected during the night and indoors to ensure maximum lack of light. __Bottom:__ Sensor temperatures during the day light data collection. this data was taken between 9:00 and 11:30 a.m. outdoors. \n",
    "On both cases the device with the with the white filter always gets warmer than the one with the cos-corrected one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Spectra.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now turn into the spectra collected. The first step is to choose a black reference signal and use it to substract the black-current noise level. Here we choose two of the first spectra obtained (measure 3) blocking the sensors, as they are the closest in temperature to the ones collected in the daylight (__Is this adequate?__). The two references are shown below.\n",

    "### Blocked sensor reference signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](blackrefs.png) F4. Black References. The idea is to produce an extensive data base of black references to query and calibrate depending on the temperature. So far I have around a 1000 data sets. Another option is to compute this before every measurement run. __This is something you have to decide.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The two signals in what it is dicussed below are used as references.\n",
    "\n",
    "### White references and Reflectance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although a way of computing $R$ is somehow suggested [here](http://www.spectrecology.com/2015/08/two-channel-radiometry-for-reflectance-oceanview-schematic/), which is summarised as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $y_{k}$, $k=1,2$ represent the raw spectra obtained with the STS-devices, 1 being the cosine-corrector fibre and 2 the white fiber and let $y_{k,b}$ represent the respective black references, Then if we somehow obtain a white reference for each device by means of a standard lambertian surface and __I supposse__ a maximum sunlight represented by $y_{k,w}$. Then the $R$ can be computed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{lcr}\n",
    "\\mbox{Substract black ref} & s_k=y_k-y_{k,b} & (1) \\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{Divide by white ref} & s'_k=s_k/y_{k,w} & (2) \\\\\n",
    "\\mbox{Divide cos-corr by white signal} & R=s'_1/s'_2 & (3) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{array} \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$R=\\frac{y_{2,w}}{y_{1,w}} \\frac{y_1-y_{1,b}}{y_2 - y_{2,b}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where 1 and 2 refer to the cos-corrected and white filters respectively, the prefactor $$\\Gamma_{2,1}=\\frac{y_{2,w}}{y_{1,w}}$$ is then a quantity that as well as the black references requires to be precomputed. __However is it really neccessary?. Even more, is this the way you though to compute $R$?, actually is it also necessary to substract the black levels to the white references?__ In any case, below I show you some results of doing several computations.\n",

    "#### Flytrap, Leaf, Grass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I show the results of carrying out several measurements using STS-NIRs for three different plants a Venus flytrap (F5), a leaf (F6) and grass (F7). These were measured over a space of a couple of hours with a varying degree of light, due to sun position and cloud variation. In every figure I show the raw data from each of the spectrometers with labels as described below, a minor correction I used to avoid division by zero which is adding to the signal the minimum value of the array plus $\\delta=1e-6$ and then the ratio and the correction according to the definion of $R$. These spectra are yet to be rescaled in the x axis to indicate the wavelength, but all are in the NIR range.\n",

    "### White vs White.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally I am still not very certain about the scaling factor between white references, I did have a quick look to the difference between raw spectra from the white filter and a Lambert reference using the cos corrected. It is linear until the IR limit is reached, but I suppose this is something that perhaps it is not relevant at the moment, it pretty much indicates the scaling factor between the two STS devices.\n",
    "\n",
    "The measures show that the spectra collected by the fiber with the white reference is more sensitive to changes in light conditions compared to the Lambert reflectance, at the end of the day I really do not know if this is relevant or not, but I would be happy to dig more into this, so the device and the scripts take everyhing into account.\n",
